## Hot-Map
#### Version 0.21 Beta

It is highly suggested that you assign hotkeys before using this app. This can be done from the settings under "keybindings".

Open the console and begin typing a folder name. When your target folder is selected press tab or enter to add a bookmark to it.

There are also 4 hot-keys (the maximum allowed by chrome extensions) that you can assign to folders for instant book mark creation.
